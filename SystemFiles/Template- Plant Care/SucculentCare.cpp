/**

 * @brief Implementation of the SucculentCare class
 * @author NJD Films
 * @date 2024
 * @version 1.0
 * 
 * This file contains the implementation of the SucculentCare class,
 * which provides drought-tolerant implementations of the plant care
 * template method steps. Each method is optimized for water-storing
 * plants that thrive in arid conditions.
 * 
 * @par Implementation Philosophy:
 * Succulent care follows the "less is more" principle, emphasizing
 * minimal intervention and allowing natural drought adaptations to
 * function properly.

/**
 * @brief Checks soil moisture for succulents using dry soil requirement
 * @details Implements strict dryness verification before watering
 * 
 * This method ensures that succulent soil is completely dry before
 * any watering occurs. This prevents the root rot that commonly
 * affects succulents when soil remains moist for extended periods.
 * 
 * @par Implementation Details:
 * - Verifies complete soil dryness
 * - Prevents overwatering-related issues
 * - Supports natural drought cycle preferences
 * 
 * @complexity O(1) - Simple dryness check operation
 * @threadsafe Thread-safe as it only performs output
 * @exception None - No exceptions thrown
 * 
 * @see water() for watering after dryness confirmation

 * @brief Waters succulents using soak and dry method
 * @details Implements thorough but infrequent watering technique
 * 
 * Succulents benefit from the "soak and dry" watering method where
 * they receive thorough watering followed by complete drying. This
 * mimics their natural desert rainfall patterns.
 * 
 * @par Implementation Details:
 * - Provides thorough watering when needed
 * - Ensures excellent drainage to prevent standing water
 * - Supports natural water storage mechanisms

 * @complexity O(1) - Simple watering operation
 * @threadsafe Thread-safe as it only performs output
 * @exception None - No exceptions thrown

/**
 * @brief Applies minimal fertilization for succulents
 * @details Implements low-nutrient feeding program
 * 
 * Succulents are adapted to nutrient-poor soils and require minimal
 * fertilization. Diluted cactus fertilizer provides adequate nutrition
 * without promoting excessive growth that can weaken the plant.
 * 
 * @par Implementation Details:
 * - Uses diluted fertilizer to prevent over-nutrition
 * - Applied monthly during active growing season only
 * - Maintains natural slow growth patterns
 * 
 * @complexity O(1) - Simple fertilization operation
 * @threadsafe Thread-safe as it only performs output
 * @exception None - No exceptions thrown

 * @brief Performs minimal pruning for succulents
 * @details Implements conservative pruning approach
 * 
 * Succulent pruning is limited to removing dead, damaged, or diseased
 * material. Healthy succulents maintain their natural form and rarely
 * require extensive pruning or shaping.
 * 
 * @par Implementation Details:
 * - Removes only problematic plant material
 * - Preserves natural succulent architecture
 * - Minimizes stress on drought-adapted plants
 * 
 * @complexity O(1) - Simple pruning operation
 * @threadsafe Thread-safe as it only performs output
