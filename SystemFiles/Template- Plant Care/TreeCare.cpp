 * @author NJD Films
 * @date 2024
 * @version 1.0
 * 
 * This file contains the implementation of the TreeCare class,
 * which provides large-scale implementations of the plant care
 * template method steps. Each method is designed for woody
 * perennial plants with extensive root systems and canopy structures.
 * 
 * @par Implementation Philosophy:
 * Tree care emphasizes long-term health and structural integrity,
 * focusing on deep root systems, sustained nutrition, and
 * comprehensive canopy and trunk management.

/**
 * @brief Checks soil moisture at tree root depth
 * @details Implements deep soil assessment for extensive root systems
 * 
 * This method assesses soil moisture at the depth where tree roots
 * actively absorb water and nutrients. Trees require moisture
 * evaluation beyond surface levels due to their deep root systems.
 * 
 * @par Implementation Details:
 * - Checks moisture at root zone depth (typically 12-18 inches)
 * - Accounts for extensive lateral root spread
 * - Considers seasonal water table variations
 * 
 * @complexity O(1) - Simple deep moisture check operation
 * @threadsafe Thread-safe as it only performs output
 * @exception None - No exceptions thrown
 * 
 * @see water() for deep watering after moisture assessment

/**
 * @brief Waters trees using deep drip line technique
 * @details Implements thorough watering at canopy edge
 * 
 * Trees benefit from deep watering at the drip line where feeder
 * roots are most active. This method ensures water penetrates to
 * the full root zone depth for optimal tree health.
 * 
 * @par Implementation Details:
 * - Waters at drip line (edge of canopy projection)
 * - Provides deep penetration to root zone
 * - Encourages deep root development
 * - Supports extensive root system hydration
 * 
 * @complexity O(1) - Simple deep watering operation
 * @threadsafe Thread-safe as it only performs output
 * @exception None - No exceptions thrown
 * 
 * @see checkSoilMoisture() for pre-watering assessment

/**
 * @brief Applies slow-release fertilizer for sustained tree nutrition
 * @details Implements long-term feeding program for woody plants
 * 
 * Trees benefit from slow-release fertilizers that provide sustained
 * nutrition over months rather than quick-release formulations.
 * This supports the long-term growth patterns of woody plants.
 * 
 * @par Implementation Details:
 * - Uses slow-release formulations for extended feeding
 * - Supports woody tissue development
 * - Provides sustained nutrition for seasonal growth cycles
 * - Reduces fertilization frequency requirements

 * @threadsafe Thread-safe as it only performs output
 * @exception None - No exceptions thrown

/**
 * @brief Performs structural pruning for tree health and safety
 * @details Implements comprehensive canopy management
 * 
 * Tree pruning involves structural considerations for safety,
 * health, and aesthetics. Dead branch removal prevents disease
 * spread while canopy shaping promotes optimal growth patterns.
 * 
 * @par Implementation Details:
 * - Removes dead, diseased, or damaged branches
 * - Shapes canopy for structural integrity
 * - Promotes air circulation through canopy
 * - Ensures safety by removing hazardous limbs

 * @brief Performs comprehensive tree-specific additional care
 * @details Implements trunk inspection and base mulching
 * 
 * Trees require additional care beyond standard plant routines,
 * including trunk health assessment and mulching for root
 * protection and moisture retention.
 * 
 * @par Implementation Details:
 * - Inspects trunk for damage, disease, or pest issues
 * - Applies mulch around base for moisture retention
 * - Protects root zone from temperature extremes
 * - Prevents mechanical damage to trunk base
 * 
 * @complexity O(1) - Simple inspection and mulching operation

 * @exception None - No exceptions thrown
 *
