 * without becoming waterlogged. Roses prefer evenly moist soil
 * that drains well to prevent root rot while supporting healthy growth.

 * @complexity O(1) - Simple moisture check operation
 * @threadsafe Thread-safe as it only performs output

 * @brief Waters roses using proper deep watering technique

 * 
 * Roses should be watered deeply at the base to encourage deep
